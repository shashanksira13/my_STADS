    % When the shutter is closed, the memory node can still be struck by
    % electrons. Even though its sensitivity id lower (By a factor of PLS),
    % This can lead to noise in the sensor output. Note that the time taken
    % has to be 1 / Capture Rate and not the Exposure Time as the memory
    % node can be struck by electrons at any moment. (Check)
    % Anyways, it's too less to be of any concern right now.
