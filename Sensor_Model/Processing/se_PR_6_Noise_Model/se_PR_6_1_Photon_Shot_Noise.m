    % Suppose that a distant star emits a stream of phtons in all
    % directions. These photons are emitted at random instants. When
    % looking at this value, the number of total phtons varies only
    % infinitesimally with time. However, by the time the photons reach our
    % sensor, they are only handful in number, and the relative
    % fluctuations in the number of photons is significant. These
    % fluctuations are captured by shot noise. 
    % For modelling shot noise, the number of phtons hitting the sensor is
    % modelled as a Poisson distribution with mean as the number of photons
    % that should have hit the pixel. So, we generate a Poisson Random
    % Variable with mean as the expected Pixel Value to get the actual
    % Pixel Value.
