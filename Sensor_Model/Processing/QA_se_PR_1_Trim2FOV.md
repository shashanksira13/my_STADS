1.In line 23, The description is given for m_1 whereas 
se_bo is a table with input (1, m_2)


2. Since only 1 boresight input needs to be passed, consider renaming 
the input parameter as se_bo creates confusion as it is also referring
to the 15x4 table of all boresights.



**Implementation:**
> The changes implemented as suggested by the review points will be documented
