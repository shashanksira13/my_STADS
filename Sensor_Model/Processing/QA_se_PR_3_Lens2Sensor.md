**QA suggestions:**
> Any modifications/additions/deletions to be made to the code. It also includes any flaws/mistakes that need to be corrected in the code

1. On running the code, the broadcasted focal length and
pixel size is not added to se_T but the changes are reflected in
the variable 'ans'. 

2. The format of nomenclature for a vector is that it should be 
prefixed by v_quantity and suffixed by the reference frame that it
is in. (So r3 should be renamed to v_ref_Lens.)

3.The measured quantities are to be suffixed by _m.
**Implementation:**
> The changes implemented as suggested by the review points will be documented
*Eg:*1. All changes are implemented
