%q_bi here is like the quat matrix.
%In the quat matrix each row corresponds to a quaternion
%the test code creates 20 test cases at a time therefore q_bi has 20 rows
q_bi = zeros(20,4);


for j = 1:20
    %the convert function take input from the csv file created using the
    %test code and convert it into the es_input.mat format whic is
    %compatible with our main code. It doesn't convert the whole q_bi,
    %whereas is does so one row at a time i.e one quaterinon at a time i.e.
    %the test case number
    es_testing_convert(j);
