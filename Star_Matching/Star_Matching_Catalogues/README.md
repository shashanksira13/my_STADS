## Star Matching - Star Catalogue

### Author - KT Prajwal Prathiksh

This folder contains the code to generate the Star Catalogues required for **Star Matching** - block of STADS.

We currently use the SKY2000 Star Catalogue.

*Refer:* http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/catalogs/sky2k.html

The following data fields of the SKY2000 Catalogue are used:

1. SKY2000 - *Identifier based on J2000 position*
1. RAJ2000 - *Right ascension (J2000) hours - ("h - m - s")*
1. DEJ2000 - *Declination degrees (J2000) - ("d - m - s")*
1. pmRA - *Proper motion in RA (J2000) - second per year*
1. pmDE - *Proper motion in Dec (J2000) - second of arc per year*
1. Vmag - *Photometric magnitude - (Optical V band between 500 and 600 nm)*

The catalogues are classified as follows:

* **st_Guide_Star_Catalogue.csv :** This Catalogue has been generated specifically for the purpose of Star Matching. It contains the following data fields:
	1. **SSP_ID** - The fictitious identifier of all those stars which satisfy the condition, that their **Vmag** is <= the Limiting Magnitude (= 6)
	1. **[X, Y, Z]** - The Cartesian unit vector representation of each star generated from its Right-Ascension and Declination coordinate. The (X, Y, Z) coordinate system definition corresponds to the projection of the Earthâ€™ North Pole onto the celestial sphere as the Z-axis, and the vernal equinox as the X-axis,at epoch ICRS2000, with the Y-axis completing the right-handed orthonormal coordinate system: Z = X \times Y

* **st_Preprocessed_Star_Catalogue.csv :** This Catalogue has been generated specifically for the purpose of Star Matching. It contains the following data fields:
	1.**SSP_ID_1** - The SSP-ID of (i-th) star
	1.**SSP_ID_2** - The SSP-ID of (j-th) star
	1. **AngDst_cos** - The dot product of the Cartesian unit vector corresponding to the (i-th) and (j-th) star
	1. **AngDst_deg** - The cos inverse of the corresponding dot product value in degrees
	* This catalogue has only those pairs of stars whose **AngDst_deg** is <= (2 \times circular Field-of-View) (=2 \times 17.89 degrees)


A detailed README of the SKY2000 catalogue is also present.
