### Iteration - 1

**Code Author:** KT Prajwal Pratiksh


**Review requested by:** KT Prajwal Pratiksh


**Reviewer:** Neilabh Banzal


**Date of review:**	17/05/2020


**Permanent Links:**

1. [ca_DMS2degrees.m](https://github.com/Jamun-Fanatic-Foreva/STADS/blob/a5c8b3f7faa5086019f0ebc7c9096d01c6978cfa/Catalogue/SKY2000/Functions/ca_DMS2degrees.m)

**QA suggestions:**

1. Lines 5, 7, 9: There is no data type in Matlab called `Float`. Check documentation or run `help class`

2. [Sign Function](https://in.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sign.html) to be used instead of user-defined function for compactness and robustness (Suppose in a commit, somebody edits the user defined function?)

3. Use assert commands to ensure that only valid input goes in. Right now, I could use an input of 100 seconds, which makes no sense at all.
