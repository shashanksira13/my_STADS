This repository contains codes for the open-loop simulations for STADS.


## Note
 1. Always run from the root folder - `.\`
 >   * Type `pwd` in the command window of MATLAB.
  >  *  `ans = ".....\STADS"`

2. Load `STADSMatlab.prj`, before writing/updating any of the codes:
> * This loads all the previously added directories to the project path
> * In case a directory is not added to path, go to the `Projects` tab and add the required directories to path
